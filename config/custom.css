  Custom NotebookX Stylesheet
  ----------------------------

  This file allows you to customize the appearance of your NotebookX outputs.
  You can modify the styles for text outputs, code cells, execution results,
  and other notebook elements.

  How to Use:
  - Define styles for `.notebook-output` to customize how outputs appear.
  - Use `.code-cell` to modify the appearance of code cells.
  - Target `.execution-result` to style the results of executed cells.
  - Add custom fonts, colors, or layouts as needed.

  Example:
  .notebook-output {
      font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;
      background-color: #f5f5f5;
      padding: 10px;
      border-radius: 5px;
  }

  Save this file and apply it via the NotebookX settings or by placing it
  in the appropriate directory.

  Happy styling!
